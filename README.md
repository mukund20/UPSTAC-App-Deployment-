# UPSTAC-App
The application named UPSTAC (Unified Platform for Syndromic mapping, Testing, Analytics and Consultation), which is essentially a simple healthcare-based web application.  

The back end of this application is written in Java, while the front end uses the React framework. And the database is built on MySQL.

The code is not mine. I am just deploying this application to AWS EC2.(  Manual Deployment)
